students 
in raising
 
questions about the world around them.
 
Though not developm
entally ready for in

depth 
explanations, 
kindergarten students
 
wonder why things move and note the various patterns
 
in 
their movement (e.g., the sun and the moon appear and disappear in the sky)
. 
Students 
learn to 
use whole numbers to describe scientific d
ata and how to identify parts of things (i.e. tools and 
toys).  Kindergarteners
 
use their senses 
(sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound) to group objects
 
and to make observations about the physical world by describing, comparing
, and sort
ing
 
items 
according to physical attributes (i.e. number, shape, texture, size, weight, color, and motion). 
They learn to follow rules to stay safe.

whole numbers to analyze scientific data. They identify how magnets pull on all things made of 
iron and either 
attract 
or 
repel 
other magnets. First graders create drawings that correctly depict 
something being desc
ribed. The students are asked to plan and carry out simple investigations to 
understand patterns (shadows, sound, weather, and daily needs of plants and animals) observed 
in the world around them and make predictions based on these investigations. They fol

The Fourth Grade Georgia Standards of Excellence for science engage students in constructing 
meaningful models that allow them to gain understandi
ng of the natural world. They speculate 
about observations they make. They add, subtract, multiply and divide whole numbers on paper, 
mentally, and with calculators. They list common materials for making simple mechanical 
constructions and for repairing th
ings. Fourth graders gather and interpret data and use records, 
tables, or graphs to identify patterns of change. They write instructions and make sketches that 
allow others to carry out a scientific investigation. They determine whether or not a compariso
n 
is fair if conditions are different for each thing being compared. They question claims or 
statements made by people outside their field of expertise. The students will use 
these skills
 
to 
compare and contrast the physical attributes of stars and planets, model the effects of the relative 
motion of the Earth and moon around the sun, use weather charts/maps to predict weather events, 
conduct investigations about the water cycle and unders
tand their relationship with heat energy, 
communicate information about the nature of light and sound, study the effects of balanced and 
unbalanced forces on an object, and describe the flow of energy in an ecosystem and the roles 
organisms play in a commu
nity.

Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge 
about the natural world. To bec

possess sufficient 
understanding of fundamental 
science content knowledge, the
 
ability to engage in

to
 
use scientific and technological information correctly.
 
Technology

They understand that science is a process for gaining kn

are able to conduct experiments and report their findings in the form of written 
reports, charts, an
d various other presentations including multi

media projects. Their scientific 
explanations emphasize evidence and begin to use scientific principles, models, and theories.
 
 
Fifth graders keep records of investigations and observations and understand why t
hey should 
not alter records. They use numerical data to describe and compare objects, 
convert the fractions
 
to decimals in scientific calculations,
 
and
 
identify the largest and smallest possible value of 
something
.
 
They 
use reference books, magazines or n

locate scientific information
.
 
 
Students at this grade level are able to identify the causes 
of 

explain the difference between a physical and a chemical change, investigate electricity 
and 
magnetism and the relationship between them, use scientific procedures to classify organisms, 
understand the difference between behaviors and traits, contrast the parts of animal and plant 
cells, and argue from evidence on how microorganisms can be ben

ed as 
the core of the standards
 
to determine appropriate content and

Science 
Georgia Standards of Excellence focus on a limited number of core disciplinary ideas 
and crosscutting concepts which build from Kindergarten to high school. The standards are 
written with the core knowledge to be mastered integrated with the science and en
gineering 
practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design.
 
Crosscutting concepts 
are used to make connections across different science disciplines.
 
 
The Science Georgia Standards of Excellence 
drive instruction. Hands

e emphasis of instruction. The
 
standards are
 
a required 
minimum set of expectations 
that 
show proficiency in science. However, instruction can
 
extend 
beyond the
se
 
minimum expectations 
to meet student needs. 
At the same time, these standards set 
a maximum expectation on what will be assessed by the Georgia Milestones Assessment System.
 
 
 
Science consists of a way of thinking and investigating, as well a growing body of knowledge 
about the natural world. To bec
ome literate in science, students need to 
possess sufficient 
understanding of fundamental 
science content knowledge, the
 
ability to engage in 
the science 
and engineering practices, and
 
to
 
use scientific and technological information correctly.
 
Technology 
s
hould be infused into the curriculum and the safety

d always be 
foremost in 
instruction.
 
 
The 
Eighth
 
Grade Georg
ia Standards of Excellence for s
cience are designed to give all students 
the necessary skills for a smooth transition from elementary physical science standards to high 
school physical science standards. The purpose is to give all students an overview of common 
strands in physical science including, but not limited to, the natu
re of matter, 
conservation of 
energy, energy transformations, conservation of 
matter, 
kinematics, and dynamics
. These 
standards are not
 
intended in any way to take the place of the high school physical science 
standards
.
 
 
Eighth grade students
 
keep re
cords
 
of their observations, 
use those records to analyze the data 
they collect
, 
rec
ognize patterns in the data, use 
simple charts and graphs
 
to represent the 
relationships they see,
 
and find more than one 
way to interpret their findings
. They develop 
conceptua
l understanding of
 
the laws of conservation of matter
 
and
 
conservation of energy
, are 
able to explain the characteristics of the
 
motion
 
of an object (speed, acceleration)
 
and 
the way 
that forces may change the state of motion of an object
. They use what they observe to explain 
the difference between physical and chemical changes and cause and effect relationships 
between force, mass, and the motion of objects. 
Students in eighth grade construct explanations 
based on evidence on the differe
nce and similarities between electromagnetic and mechanical 
waves. 
Eigh
th graders 
plan and carry out investigations
, describe observations, and show 
information in graphical form. 
T
